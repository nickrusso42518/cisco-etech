\subsection{Compute virtualization}
Conceptually, containers and virtual machines are similar in that they are a
way to virtualize services/machines on a single platform, effectively
achieving multi-tenancy. The subsections of this section will focus on their
differences and use cases, rather than discuss them at the top-level
section. \\

A brief discussion on two new design paradigms popular within any data center
is warranted. \textbf{Hyper-convergence and disaggregation} are polar
opposites but are both highly effective in solving specific business problems. \\

Hyper-convergence attempts to address issues with data center management and
resource consumption/provisioning. For example, the traditional DC
architecture will consist of four main components: network, storage, compute,
and services (firewalls, load balancers, etc.). These decoupled items could be
combined into a single and unified management infrastructure. The
virtualization and management layers are integrated into a single appliance,
and these appliances can be bolted together to scale-out linearly. Cisco
sometimes refers to this as the Lego block model. This reduces the capital
investments a business must make over time since the architecture need not
change as the business grows. Hyper-converged systems, by virtue of their
integrated management solution, simplify life cycle management of DC assets as
the ``single pane of glass'' concept can be used to manage all components.
Cisco's Hyperflex (also called Flexpod) is an example of a hyper-converged
solution. \\

Disaggregation is the opposite of hyper-convergence in that rather than
combining functions (storage, network, and compute) into a single entity, it
breaks them apart even further. A network appliance, such as a router or
switch, can be decoupled from its network operating system (NOS). A white box
or brite box switch can be purchased at low cost with some other NOS
installed, such as Cumulus Linux. Cumulus generally does not sell hardware,
only a NOS, much like VMware. Server/computer disaggregation has been around
for decades since the introduction of the personal computer (PC) whereby the
common Microsoft Windows operating system was installed on machines from a
variety of manufacturers. Disaggregation in the network realm has been adopted
more slowly but has merit for the same reasons.
\subsubsection{Virtual Machines}
Virtual machine systems rely on a hypervisor, which is a software shim that
sits between the VMs themselves and the underlying hardware. The hardware
chipset would need to support this virtualization, which is a technique to
present hardware to VMs through the hypervisor. Each VM has its own OS which
is independent from the hypervisor. Hypervisors come in two flavors:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Type 1:} Runs on bare metal and is effectively an OS by
  itself. VMware ESXi and Linux Kernel-based  Virtual Machine (KVM) and are
  examples.
  \item \textbf{Type 2:} Requires an underlying OS and provides virtualization
  services on top through a hardware abstraction layer (HAL). VMware
  Workstation and VirtualBox are examples.
\end{enumerate}

VMs are considered quite heavyweight with respect to the overhead needed to
run them. This can reduce the efficiency of a hardware platform as the VM
count grows. It is especially inefficient when all of the VMs run the same OS
with very few differences other than configuration. A demonstration of
virtual machines is included in the NFVIS section of this document and is
focused on virtual network functions (VNF).

\subsubsection{Containers with Docker Demonstration}
Containers on a given machine all share the same OS, unlike with VMs. This
reduces the amount of overhead, such as idle memory taxes, storage space for
VM OS images, and the general maintenance associated with maintaining VMs.
Multi-tenancy is achieved by memory isolation, effectively segmenting the
different services deployed in different containers. There is still a thin
software shim between the underlying OS and the containers known as the
container manager, which enforces the multi-tenancy via memory isolation and
other techniques. \\

The main drawback of containers is that all containers must share the same OS.
For applications or services where such behavior is desired (for example, a
container per customer consuming a specific service), containers are a good
choice. As a general-purpose virtualization platform in environments where
requirements may change often (such as military networks), containers are a
poor choice. \\

Docker and Linux Containers (LXC) are popular examples of container engines.
The image that follow is from from \url{www.docker.com} that compares VMs to
containers at a high
level.

This book does not detail the full Docker installation on CentOS because it is
already well-documented and not relevant to learning about containers. Once
Docker has been installed, run the following verification commands to ensure
it is functioning correctly. Any modern version of Docker is sufficient to
follow the example that will be discussed.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ which docker && docker --version
/usr/bin/docker
Docker version 17.09.1-ce, build 19e2cf6
\end{minted}


Begin by running a new CentOS7 container. These images are stored on DockerHub
and are automatically downloaded when they are not locally present. For
example, this machine has not run any containers yet, and no images have been
explicitly downloaded. Thus, Docker is smart enough to pull the proper image
from DockerHub and spin up a new container. This only takes a few seconds on a
high-speed Internet connection. Once complete, Docker drops the user into a
new shell as the root user inside the container. The -i and -t options enable
an interactive TTY session, respectively, which is great for demonstrations.
Note that running Docker containers in the background is much more common as
there are typically many containers.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ docker container run -it centos:7
Unable to find image 'centos:7' locally
7: Pulling from library/centos
469cfcc7a4b3: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:989b936d56b1ace20ddf855a301741e52abca38286382cba7f44443210e96d16
Status: Downloaded newer image for centos:7

[root@088bbd2a7544 /]# 
\end{minted}

To verify that the correct container was downloaded, run the following
command. Then, exit from the container, as the only use for CentOS7 in our
example is to serve as a ``base'' image for the custom Ansible image to be
created.

\begin{minted}{text}
[root@088bbd2a7544 /]# cat /etc/redhat-release 
CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708 (Core) 

[root@088bbd2a7544 /]# exit
\end{minted}

Exiting from the container effectively halts it, much like a process exiting
in Linux. Two interesting things have occurred. First, the image that was
downloaded is now stored locally in the image list. The image came from the
``centos'' repository with a tag of 7. Tags typically differentiate between
variants of a common image, such as version numbers or special features.
Second, the container list shows a CentOS7 container that recently exited.
Every container gets a random hexadecimal ID and random text names for
reference. The output can be very long, and so has been edited to fit the page
neatly.
 
\begin{minted}{text}

\end{minted}

To build a custom image, one creates a Dockerfile. It is a plain text file
that closely resembles a shell script and is designed to procedurally assemble
the required components of a container image for use later. The author already
created a Dockerfile using a CentOS7 image as a basic image and added some
additional features to it. Every step has been commented for clarity. \\

Dockerfiles are typically written to minimize the both number of ``layers'' and
amount of build time. Each instruction generally qualifies as a layer. The
more complex and less variable layers should be placed towards the top of the
Dockerfile, making them deeper layers. For example, installing key packages
and cloning the code necessary for the containers primary purpose occurs
early. Layers that are more likely to change, such as version-specific Ansible
environment setup parameters, can come later. This way, if the Ansible
environment changes and the image needs to be rebuilt, only the layers at or
after the point of modification must be rebuilt. The base CentOS7 image and
original yum package installations remain unchanged, substantially reducing
the image build time. Fewer RUN directives also results in fewer layers, which
explains the extensive use of \&\& and \ in the Dockerfile.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ cat Dockerfile
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{docker}

HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m CMD which ansible || exit 1
\end{minted}

The Dockerfile is effectively a set of instructions used to build a custom
image. To build the image based on the Dockerfile, issue the command below.
The -t option specifies a tag, and in this case, ``cmd\_authz'' is used since
this particular Dockerfile is using a specific branch from a specific Ansible
developer's personal Github page. It would be unwise to call this simple
``ansible'' or ``ansible:latest'' due to the very specific nature of this
container and subsequent test. Because the user is in the same directory as
the Dockerfile, specify the ``.'' to choose the current directory. Each of the 5
steps in the Dockerfile (FROM, RUN, RUN, WORKDIR, and HEALTHCHECK) are logged
in the output below. The output looks almost identical to what one would see
through stdout.

Once complete, there will be a new image in the image list. Note that there
are not any new containers, since this image has not been run yet. It is ready
to be instantiated as a container, or even pushed up to DockerHub for others
to use. Last, note that the container more than doubled in size. Because many
new packages were added for specific purposes, this makes the container less
portable. Smaller is always better, especially for generic images.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG           IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

\end{minted}

For additional detail about this image, the following command returns
extensive data in JSON format. Docker uses a technique called layering whereby
each command in a Dockerfile is a layer, and making changes later in the
Dockerfile won't affect the lower layers. This is why the things least likely
to change should be placed towards the top, such as the base image, common
package installs, etc. This reduces image building time when Dockerfiles are
changed.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ docker image inspect a8a6ac1b44e2 | head -5
[
    {
        "Id": "sha256:a8a6ac1b44e28f654572bfc57761aabb5a92019c[snip]",
        "RepoTags": [
            "ansible:cmd_authz"
[snip]
\end{minted}

To run a container, use the same command shown earlier to start the CentOS7
container. Specify the image name and in less than second, the new container
is 100\% operational. Ansible should be installed on this container as part of
the image creation process, so be sure to test this. Running the ``setup''
module on the control machine (the container itself) should yield several
lines of JSON output about the device itself. Note that, towards the bottom of
this output dump, ansible is aware that it is inside a Docker container.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ docker container run -it ansible:cmd_authz
[root@04eb3ee71a52 examples]# which ansible && ansible -m setup localhost 
/ansible/bin/ansible
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        [snip, lots of information]
        "ansible_virtualization_type": "docker", 
        "gather_subset": [
            "all"
        ], 
        "module_setup": true
    }, 
    "changed": false
}
\end{minted}

Next, create the playbook used to test the specific issue. The full playbook
is shown below. For those not familiar with Ansible at all, please see the
Ansible demonstration in this book, or go to the author's Github page for many
production-quality examples. This 3 step playbook is simple:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define the login credentials so Ansible can log into the router.
  \item Log into the router, enter configuration mode, and run ``do show
  clock''. Store the output.
  \item	Print out the value of the output variable and look for the date/time
  in the JSON structure.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{minted}{yaml}
[root@04eb3ee71a52 examples]# cat issue31575.yml
---
- hosts: csr1.njrusmc.net
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli
  tasks:
    - name: "SYS >> Define router credentials"
      set_fact:
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}" 
          username: "ansible"
          password: "ansible"

    - name: "IOS >> Run show command from config mode" 
      ios_config:
        provider: "{{ provider }}"
        commands: "do show clock"
        match: none
      register: output

    - name: "DEBUG >> Print output"
      debug:
        var: output
...
\end{minted}

Before running this playbook, a few Ansible adjustments are needed. First,
adjust the ansible.cfg file to use the hosts.yml inventory file and disable
host key checking. Ansible needs to know which network devices are in its
inventory and how to handle unknown SSH keys.

\begin{minted}{text}
[root@04eb3ee71a52 examples]# head -20 ansible.cfg 
[snip, comments]
[defaults]

# some basic default values...

inventory         = hosts.yml
host_key_checking = False
\end{minted}

Next, ensure the inventory contains the specific router in question. In this
case, it is a Cisco CSR1000v running in AWS. Note that we would have used
``echo'' commands in our Dockerfile to address these issues in advance, but this
specific information makes the docker image less useful and less portable.

\begin{minted}{yaml}
[root@04eb3ee71a52 examples]# head -20 hosts.yml
---
# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
all:
  hosts:
    csr1.njrusmc.net
\end{minted}

Before connecting, ensure your container can use DNS to resolve the IP address
for the router's hostname (assuming you are using DNS), and ensure the
container can ping the router. This rules out any networking problems. The
author does not show the initial setup of the CSR1000v, which includes adding
a username/password of ansible/ansible, and nothing else.

\begin{minted}{text}
[root@04eb3ee71a52 examples]# ping –c 3 csr1.njrusmc.net
PING csr1.njrusmc.net (18.x.x.x) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from ec2-18-x-x-x.x.com (18.x.x.x): icmp_seq=1 ttl=253 time=0.884 ms

--- csr1.njrusmc.net ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms
\end{minted}

The last step executes the playbook from inside the container. This
illustrates the original issue that the ios\_config module, at the time of this
writing, does not return device output. The author's personal preference is to
always print the Ansible version number before running playbooks designed to
test issues. This reduces the likelihood of invalid test results due to
version confusion. In the DEBUG step below, there is no date/time output,
which helps illustrate the Ansible issue that is being investigated.

\begin{minted}{text}

\end{minted}

After exiting this container, check the list of containers again. Now, there
were 2 containers in the past, the newest one at the top. This was the Ansible
container we just exited after completing our test. Again, some output has
been truncated to make the table fit neatly.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker build]$ docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND      CREATED   STATUS         PORTS   NAMES

\end{minted}

This manual ``start and stop'' approach to containerization has several
drawbacks. Two are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item	To retest this solution, the playbook would have to be created again,
  and the Ansible environment files (ansible.cfg, hosts.yml) would need to be
  updated again. Because containers are ephemeral, this information is not
  stored automatically.
  \item	The commands are difficult to remember and it can be a lot to type,
  especially when starting many containers. Since containers were designed for
  microservices and expected to be deployed in dependent groups, this
  management strategy scales poorly.
\end{enumerate}
  
Docker includes a feature called \verb|docker-compose|. Using YAML syntax,
developers can specify all the containers they want to start, along with any minor
options for those containers, then execute the compose file like a script. It
is better than a shell script since it is more portable and easier to read. It
is also an easy way to add volumes to Docker. There are different kinds of
volumes, but in short, volumes allow persistent data to be passed into and
retrieved from containers. In this example, a simple directory mapping (known
as a ``bind mount'' in Docker) is built from the local mnt\_files/ folder to the
container's file system. In this folder, one can copy the Ansible files
(issue31575.yml, ansible.cfg, and hosts.yml) so the container has immediate
access. While it is possible to handle volume mounting from the commands
viewed previously, it is tedious and complex.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker compose]$ cat docker-compose.yml 
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{yaml}
version: '3.2'
services:
  ansible:
    image: ansible:cmd_authz
    hostname: cmd_authz
    # Next two lines are equivalent of -i and -t, respectively
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./mnt_files
        target: /ansible/examples/mnt_files
\end{minted}

The contents of these files was shown earlier, but ensure they are all placed
in the mnt\_files/ directory with relation to where the docker-compose.yml file
is located.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker compose]$ tree
.
├── docker-compose.yml
└── mnt_files
    ├── ansible.cfg
    ├── hosts.yml
    └── issue31575.yml
\end{minted}

To run the docker-compose file, use the command below. It will build
containers for all keys specified under the \verb|services| dictionary. In this
case, there is only one container called \verb|ansible| which is based on the
\verb|ansible:cmd\_authz| image created earlier from the custom Dockerfile. The -i
and -t options are enabled to allow for interactive shell access. The -d
option with the docker-compose command specifies the \verb|detach| operation, which
runs the containers in the background. View the list of containers to see the
new Ansible container running successfully.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker compose]$ docker-compose up -d
Starting compose_ansible_1 ... done

[centos@docker compose]$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED    STATUS            PORTS NAMES
d3f1365f3145   ans:cmd_authz   "/bin/bash"    1 m ago   Up 32 s (health: ...)   compose_ansible_1
\end{minted}

The command below says ``execute, on the ansible container, the bash command''
which grants shell access. Ensure that the mnt\_files/ directory exists and
contains all the necessary files. Copy the contents to the current directly,
which will overwrite the basic ansible.cfg and hosts.yml files provided by
Ansible.

\begin{minted}{text}
[centos@docker compose]$ docker-compose exec ansible bash
[root@cmd_authz examples]# tree mnt_files/
mnt_files/
|-- ansible.cfg
|-- hosts.yml
`-- issue31575.yml

[root@cmd_authz examples]# cp mnt_files/* .
cp: overwrite './ansible.cfg'? y
cp: overwrite './hosts.yml'? y
\end{minted}

Run the playbook again, and observe the same results as before. Now, assuming
that this issue remains open for a long period of time, \verb|docker-compose|
helps reduce the test setup time.

\begin{minted}{text}

Exit from the container and check the container list again. Notice that,
despite exiting, the container continues to run. This is because
docker-compose created the container in a detached state, meaning the absence
of the shell does not cause the container to stop. Manually stop the container
using the commands below. Note that only the first few characters of the
container ID can be used for these operations.

\begin{minted}{text}

For total cleanup, delete these stale containers from the demonstration so
that they are not accidentally used for future use. Remember, containers are
ephemeral, and should be built and discarded regularly.

\subsubsection{Python Virtual Environments (venv) for Refactoring}
Just as containers are lighter than virtual machines in terms of their
computing and storage requirements, virtual environments are lighter than
containers. Python virtual environments, or ``venv'' for short, are effectively
separate directory structures that contain separate storage areas for
libraries, binaries, and other information specific to a development effort.
The demonstration in this section is based on a real-life Ansible refactoring
effort of the author's
\href{https://github.com/nickrusso42518/}{free open-source Ansible projects.} \\

When Ansible network modules such as \verb|ios_command| and \verb|ios_config| were
introduced, they required \verb|provider| dictionaries to log into network devices.
This dictionary wrapped basic login information such as hostname/IP address,
username, password, and timeouts into a single dictionary object. While this
technique was brilliant for its day, the Ansible team acknowledged that this
made network devices ``different'' and having a unified SSH access method would
be a better long-term solution. These features were introduced in Ansible 2.5,
but suppose you wrote all your playbooks in Ansible 2.4. How could you safely
run two versions of Ansible on a single machine to perform the necessary
refactoring? Python virtual environments (venv for short) are a good solution
to this problem. \\

First, create a new venv for Ansible 2.4.2 to demonstrate the now-deprecated
provider dictionary method. The command below creates a new directory called
\verb|ansible242/| and populates it with many files needed to create a separate
development environment. This book does not explore the inner workings of
venv, but does include a link in the references section.

\begin{minted}{text}

-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  59 Aug 22 07:06 pip-selfcheck.json
\end{minted}

The purpose of venv is to create a virtual Python workspace, so any Python
utilities and libraries should be used within the venv. To activate the venv,
use the source command to update your current shell. The prompt changes to
show the venv name at the far left. Use which to reveal that the pip binary
has been selected from within the venv.

\begin{minted}{text}
[ec2-user@devbox venv]$ which pip
/usr/bin/pip

[ec2-user@devbox venv]$ cd ansible242/
[ec2-user@devbox ansible242]$ source bin/activate

(ansible242) [ec2-user@devbox ansible242]$ which pip
~/venv/ansible242/bin/pip
\end{minted}

At this point, custom packages can be installed within the venv without
interfering with the platform-level Python packages, if any exist.

\begin{minted}{text}
(ansible242) [ec2-user@devbox ansible242]$ ls -l lib/python2.7/site-packages/
total 16
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  126 Aug 22 07:06 easy_install.py

drwxrwxr-x. 4 ec2-user ec2-user  117 Aug 22 07:06 pkg_resources
drwxrwxr-x. 5 ec2-user ec2-user 4096 Aug 22 07:06 setuptools

drwxrwxr-x. 2 ec2-user ec2-user  130 Aug 22 07:06 wheel-0.31.1.dist-info
\end{minted}

Install the correct version of Ansible using pip, and then check the
site-packages within the venv to see that Ansible 2.4.2 has been installed.

\begin{minted}{text}

drwxrwxr-x. 17 ec2-user ec2-user  4096 Aug 22 07:09 ansible

\end{minted}

The venv now has a functional Ansible 2.4.2 environment where playbook
development can begin. This demonstration shows a simple login playbook that
the author has used in production just to SSH into all devices. It's the Cisco
IOS equivalent of the Ansible ping module which is used primarily for testing
SSH reachability to Linux hosts. The source code is shown below. Note that
there are only two variables defined. The first tells Ansible which Python
binary to use to ensure the proper libraries are used. A fully qualified file
name must be used as shortcuts like ``~'' are not allowed. The second variable
is a nested login credentials dictionary.

\begin{minted}{text}

        provider: "{{ login_creds }}"
        commands: "show clock"

\end{minted}

Running the playbook with the custom inventory (containing one router called
``csr1'') and verbosity enabled so the CLI output is printed to standard
output.

\end{minted}

With the first test complete, exit the venv using the deactivate command,
which is a custom binary specific to venv that effectively reverses what the
source bin/activate command did. The shell returns to normal. Note that the
deactivate command only exists inside of the venv.

\begin{minted}{text}
(ansible242) [ec2-user@devbox login]$ deactivate
[ec2-user@devbox login]$

[ec2-user@devbox login]$ which deactivate
/usr/bin/which: no deactivate in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin)
\end{minted}

To refactor this playbook from the old provider-style login to the new
\verb|network_cli| login, create a second venv alongside the existing one. It is
is named \verb|ansible263| which is the current version of Ansible at the time of
this writing. The steps are shown below but are not explained in detail as
they were in the first example.

\begin{minted}{text}
[ec2-user@devbox venv]$ virtualenv ansible263
New python executable in /home/ec2-user/venv/ansible263/bin/python2
Also creating executable in /home/ec2-user/venv/ansible263/bin/python

\begin{minted}{text}
(ansible263) [ec2-user@devbox login]$ ansible --version
ansible 2.6.3
\end{minted}

Ansible playbook development can begin now, and to save some time, recursively
copy the login playbook from the old venv into the new one. Because Python
virtual environments are really just separate directory structures, moving
source code between them is easy. It is worth noting that source code does not
have to exist inside a venv. It may exist in one specific location and the
refactoring effort could be doen on a version control feature branch. In this
way, multiple venvs could access a common code base. In this simple example,
code is copied between venvs.

\begin{minted}{text}
(ansible263) [ec2-user@devbox ansible263]$ cp -R ../ansible242/login/ .
(ansible263) [ec2-user@devbox ansible263]$ tree login/
login/
├── group_vars
│   └── routers.yml
├── inv.yml
└── login.yml
\end{minted}

Modify the group variables and playbook files according to the code shown
below. Rather than define a custom dictionary with login credentials, one can
specify some values for the well-known Ansible login parameters. At the
playbook, the connection changes from local to \verb|network_cli| and the inclusion
of the provider key under \verb|ios_command| is no longer needed. Last, note that the
Python interpreter path is updated for this specific venv using the directory
\verb|ansible263/|.

\begin{minted}{yaml}
(ansible263) [ec2-user@devbox login]$ cat group_vars/routers.yml
---
ansible_python_interpreter: "/home/ec2-user/venv/ansible263/bin/python"
ansible_network_os: "ios"
ansible_user: "ansible"
ansible_ssh_pass: "ansible"
...

(ansible263) [ec2-user@devbox login]$ cat login.yml
---
- name: "Login to all routers"
  hosts: routers
  connection: network_cli
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: "Run 'show clock' command"
      ios_command:
        commands: "show clock"
...
\end{minted}

Running this playbook should yield the exact same behavior as the original
playbook except modernized for the new version of Ansible. Using virtual
environments to accomplish this simplifies library and binary executable
management when testing multiple versions.
