\textbf{Author’s Notes}

This book is designed for the CCIE and CCDE certification tracks that
introduce the ``Evolving Technologies'' section of the blueprint for the written
qualification exam. It is not specific to any certification track and provides
an overview of the three key evolving technologies: Cloud, Network
Programmability, and Internet of Things (IoT). \textit{Italic text} represents
cited text from another not created by the author. This is typically directly
from a Cisco document, which is appropriate given that this is a summary of
Cisco’s vision on the topics therein. This book is not an official
publication, does not have an ISBN assigned, and is not protected by any
copyright. It is not for sale and is intended for free, unrestricted
distribution. \textbf{The book will always be free}. The opinions expressed in
this study guide and its corresponding documentation belong to the author and
do not necessarily represent those of Cisco.

I wrote this book because I believe that free and open-source software is the
way of the future. So too do I believe that the manner in which this book is
published represents the future of publishing. I hope this book serves its
obviously utility as a technical reference, but also as an inspiration for
others to meaningfully contribute to the open-source community.
