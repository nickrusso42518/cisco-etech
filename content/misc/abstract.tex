\textbf{Author’s Notes}

This book was originally designed for the CCIE and CCDE certification tracks that
introduced the ``Evolving Technologies'' section of the blueprint for the written
qualification exam. Those exams have since been overhauled and many of their
topics have been moved under the umbrella of Cisco DevNet.
This book is not specific to any certification track and provides
an overview of the three key evolving technologies: Cloud, Network
Programmability, and Internet of Things (IoT). \textit{Italic text} represents
cited text from another not created by the author. This is often directly
from a Cisco document, which is appropriate given that this is a summary of
Cisco’s vision on the topics therein. This book is not an official
publication and does not have an ISBN assigned. \textbf{The book will always be free}.
The opinions expressed in this study guide and its corresponding documentation
belong to the author and do not necessarily represent those of Cisco. My only
request is that you not distribute this book yourself. Please direct your
friends and colleagues to my website where they can download it for free.

I wrote this book because I believe that free and open-source software is the
way of the future. So too do I believe that the manner in which this book is
published represents the future of publishing. I hope this book serves its
obviously utility as a technical reference, but also as an inspiration for
others to meaningfully contribute to the open-source community.
